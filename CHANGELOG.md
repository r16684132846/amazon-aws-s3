Checksum calculation behavior can be configured using `when_supported` and `when_required` options - in code using requestChecksumCalculation, in shared config using request_checksum_calculation, or as env variable using AWS_REQUEST_CHECKSUM_CALCULATION. The S3 client attempts to validate response checksums for all S3 API operations that support checksums. However, if the SDK has not implemented the specified checksum algorithm then this validation is skipped. Checksum validation behavior can be configured using `when_supported` and `when_required` options - in code using responseChecksumValidation, in shared config using response_checksum_validation, or as env variable using AWS_RESPONSE_CHECKSUM_VALIDATION.

## [0.1.0-M0] - 03/19/2021

**WARNING: Beta releases may contain bugs and no guarantee is made about API stability. They are not recommended for production use!**

This is the initial beta release of AWS SDK Kotlin. It represents an early look at the overall API surface.


See the [Getting Started Guide](docs/GettingStarted.md) for how to work with beta releases and examples.


### Services in this release

* DynamoDB
* Polly
* Translate
* Cognito Identity Provider
* Secrets Manager
  * NOTE: Default idempotency token provider will not currently work, you'll need to override the config to create or update secrets until [#180](https://github.com/smithy-lang/smithy-kotlin/issues/180) is implemented
* KMS
* Lambda

NOTES:
* We currently can (theoretically) support any JSON based AWS protocol. If there is a service you would like to see added in a future release (before developer preview) please reach out and let us know.
* No customizations are currently implemented, some SDK's may not behave 100% correctly without such support.
* Retries, waiters, paginators, and other features are not yet implemented

### Features
* Coroutine API
* DSL Builders
* Default (environment or config) or static credential providers only. Additional providers will be added in later releases.
* JVM only support (multiplatform support is on the roadmap)
